The Site....
===============

Basically, this site is something I setup to share my learnings on GCP and ramblings/configurations on consuming different services available in GCP.

First things first, this is a personal site and any thoughts/comments are my own and not that of my employer.

Now with that out of the way... Did you know when you sign up for GCP you get $300 credit to get you started?
Feel free to sign up and check out some of the amazing services available.


Login to the `Google Cloud Platform <https://console.cloud.google.com>`_ to get started.
